# The UCI's Unethical Ethics Commission
Is the UCI Ethics Commission Ethical?

Ever read the UCI Code of Ethics? I wonder how many in pro cycling have, especially the women, after what I discovered. I found the document after Googling “UCI fairness in sport”.

https://www.uci.org/docs/default-source/rules-and-regulations/uci-code-of-ethics.pdf

TLDR; 

The UCI Ethics Commission is intended to be independent and ethical, but it’s not. It’s rules are decided by the UCI and and even the members, including replacements, are proposed by the UCI Management Committee. 

Strangely it’s the Ethics Committee that has to report on its activities to the UCI. I would have thought that it would be the other way around. That the Management Committee report on its activities to the Ethics Committee. Independence is an illusion.

Art. 6.1. on non-discrimination doesn’t even include discrimination on the grounds of gender. Yes, it’s that shocking. You’d think it would be explicitly stated but it’s relegated to the “not limited to” clause of the article, which really could included or exclude anything. 

Below are sections of the Code of Ethics that I wanted to bring attention to. Why? Well yet again the woman’s pro field are being discriminated against, this time in the aftermath of the lockdown. See The Cyclists Alliance for more on that. 

I’ve added my comments below amongst the quoted text from the Code.

It begins quite positively...

## Preamble
“The conduct of persons bound by this Code shall reflect their support of the principles of integrity and ethics and their efforts to refrain from anything that could be harmful to these aims and objectives.”

But quickly moves on to firmly placing the “independent” body under its wing. 

... “the below provisions which form an integral part of the UCI Cycling Regulations.”

Who’s actually got to live by the Code? 

## Art. 1 Persons bound by the UCI Code of Ethics

“All UCI Officials, meaning members of the UCI Management Committee, honorary members, members of UCI Commissions...”

## Art. 2 Scope of applicability

“The Code shall apply to conduct that damages the integrity and reputation of cycling and in particular to illegal, immoral and unethical behaviour.”

I don’t follow most sports, but I can’t think of another sport in recent times who’s governing body has done more damage to the reputation of the sport it governs, than the UCI. 

## Art. 3 Breach of the Code

“any breach of the Code may be established whether it was committed deliberately or negligently,”

Personally I think people in a position of power within the UCI are in breach of their own code. The UCI Ethics Commission itself needs to be shut down and a new completed INDEPENDENT ethics body needs to be established. One that is in cadence with recent changes in the world. One that’s transparent. Personally I feel it’s been a long time coming. I don’t subscribe to the “these things take time” excuses you often here. 

## Art. 5 General principles

“All persons concerned shall at all times act in compliance with the principles below in any activity related to cycling and shall immediately report any potential breach of this Code to the Secretariat of the Ethics Commission (cf. Article 13.1).”

The Cycling Alliance - Please do this now! Here are the details of the “External secretariat”

## Art. 6 General rules of integrity
### Art. 6.1. Non-discrimination

“The persons bound by the Code shall not undertake any action, use any denigratory words, or any other means, that offend the human dignity of a person or group of persons, on any grounds including but not limited to skin colour, race, religion, ethnic or social origin, political opinion, sexual orientation, disability or any other reason contrary to human dignity.”

The way that the women in cycling are treated would lead me to believe that the fact that gender isn’t listed in the article above isn’t down to a typo.

## Art. 10 Rules pertaining to relations with third parties
### Art. 10.1 Partners
“The persons bound by the Code shall undertake dealings, negotiations and decisions regarding relationships with partners, such as broadcasters, sponsors, suppliers and other supporters of cycling in compliance with the rules laid down in the present Code”

I’ve seen races where the woman’s winner will take home 1/10th of that of the men’s winner. And defenders will say that’s because there’s more money in men’s cycling. Or, the one that really gets me is that you can’t expect the men to take a pay cut. This issue was fixed in tennis, what seems like decades ago. Here’s my idea. The UCI actually does something to correct the imbalance. How? Create some rules. Isn’t that their job? They need to rewrite or create rules to put fairness and equality first. The days of sponsoring prize money for a single gender race are over. If you want to sponsor prize money for cycling, then it gets divided up equally between to races. A woman’s race, and a men’s race. This won’t work, as there are more men’s races than woman’s races. Yet more institutional discrimination. This needs to be fixed.

## Art. 12 Composition
“The Ethics Commission through its composition shall ensure that it functions in an independent manner.”

Uh huh. 

“The members of the Ethics Commission, including the President, shall be appointed by the UCI Congress, on the proposal of the Management Committee”

“In case of vacancy of a member due to resignation, removal or death, the UCI Management Committee may make a provisional appointment to be approved at the following UCI Congress.”

See how messy it is? 

## Art. 13 Principles of functioning
### Art. 13.1 Secretariat
“The Secretariat of the Ethics Commission (hereinafter: the Secretariat) shall be dealt with by a secretary appointed by the UCI Management Committee.”

Just one word, independence?

## Art. 20 Report to the UCI Congress

## Art. 21 Right to complain and right to be a party

“The Secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint or denunciation, although the person submitting the file shall have no entitlement for proceedings to be opened, to be a party to proceedings or to be informed of any decision passed.”

You have almost no rights, no chance, no transparency, and they have zero independence. 

## Art. 24 Representation

“Any party may be represented by a counsel of his choice. Any cost related to his representation before the Ethics Commission shall be borne by the party concerned.”

Let’s price the women out of the UCI “fairness system” yet again. 

## Art. 25 Languages

“All proceedings before the Ethics Commission shall be conducted in French or English. Parties introducing documents in other languages shall bear all costs related to the translation of such documents as well as oral statements.”

So much for inclusiveness. If I wasn’t born in a French or English speaking country, I’m going to end up paying for it. 

## Art. 26 Requisites for a complaint or denunciation 
### Art. 26.1 Form and address

“Notifications shall only be considered if sent to the email address of the Secretariat published on the UCI website.”

Seems really odd that you have to have an email address to make a complaint. You can’t complain using pen and paper. 

## Art. 27 Registration

“Should the file concern the UCI President directly, such information shall be provided to the members of the Executive Committee of the UCI.”

I’m hoping The Cyclists Alliance mention those at the top.

## Art. 28 Panel
### Art. 28.2 Independence, impartiality and challenge

“Any application to challenge a member of the panel shall be decided by the other members of the Ethics Commission, after the challenged member has been invited to submit written comments. A majority of the members of the Ethics Commission is required to reject a challenge. The decision on the challenge is final and is not subject to appeal.”

Challenging a member is a formality that involves the member writing a comment, everyone puts up there hand to dismiss the challenge, and they continue on with impunity. 

## Art. 34 Decisions of the Ethics Commission
### Art. 34.3 Publication
“The UCI may publish either the full version or a summary of the decision rendered by the Ethics Commission on the UCI website.”

Not exactly the definition of transparency. I have a technical background and I can guarantee them that there is plenty of space left of the web to publish the entire decision. 

## Art. 37 Proceedings before the Disciplinary Commission
“Upon receipt of the final report and consultation of the Ethics Commission’s file, the Chairman of the Disciplinary Commission shall initiate disciplinary proceedings against the persons concerned, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Disciplinary Commission, as outlined in Chapter XII of the UCI Cycling Regulations.”

Let’s hope the Disciplinary Commission isn’t in the same state as the Ethics Commission. 

## Art. 38 Specific Procedural Rules for the Disciplinary Commission
### Art. 38.2 Conduct of proceedings
“In all cases, the party shall be provided with the final report of the Ethics Commission and invited to submit his answer containing a statement of defence, any defence of lack of jurisdiction and any evidence on which he intends to rely.”

Even the wording is exclusive. Even the Code of Ethics document doesn’t pass scrutiny. Apparently there is only one gender in cycling. I’m guessing it wasn’t written by a woman. Another issue, representation. 

## APPENDIX 1

“The present Appendix aims at providing specific rules relating to the protection of physical and mental integrity in the world of cycling and implementing the International Olympic Committee’s consensus statement on ‘’Sexual harassment & Abuse in Sport’.”

So that’s the goal.

### Art. 2 Forbidden Conduct
#### Art. 2.1 Psychological abuse
“Any unwelcome act including confinement, isolation, verbal assault, humiliation, intimidation, infantilisation, or any other treatment which may diminish the sense of identity, dignity, and self-worth.”

And yet I can’t imagine there are any women in the pro field who don’t feel humiliated by the way that they have been treated over the years. Right now they’re isolated from what’s really going on in the UCI with regard to lockdown information.

It’s time for change in the UCI. It’s an ethical train wreck that needs replacing.
